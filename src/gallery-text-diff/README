This component helps you to calculate the difference between two strings using the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm.
It is able to tell you how many actions (deletion, insertion, substitution, transposition) would be neccessary to transform one string into the other. In addition to that, it calculates a diff-string, that tells you at what positions of the string, the actions would have to take place. The characters used for the different actions are configurable
